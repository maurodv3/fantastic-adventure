# Minesweeper

A classic Minesweeper game.

# TODO List
* Design and implement  a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
* Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
* When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
* Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
* Detect when game is over
* Persistence
* Time tracking
* Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
* Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
* Ability to support multiple users/accounts
